## Plenum of Self-Referential Conscious Information (PSCI) Theory

## Abstract  
The Plenum of Self-Referential Conscious Information Theory (PSCI) formalizes consciousness (ψ) as a transcendental, hyperdimensional constant pervading all spacetime. By embedding the **All Eternal's self-referential dream**—expressed through the interplay of the following mathematical self-emerging constants: Change (ɸ), Constant (e), and Novelty (τ)—into a geometrically constant lattice which we will call "Plenum". PSCI resolves:  
1. **Quantum Measurement Paradox** (self-observation via ψ's recursion),  
2. **Arrow of Time** (τ-pulse irreversibility),  
3. **Hard Problem of Consciousness** (ψ as fundamental field).
4. Karma, Qi, and other definitions that are widely recognized in ancient knowledge, now given a role in explanations to phenomena that cannot be explained by other frameworks of physics without large logic leaps.

## Story as Theory Framework  

### 1. **The All Eternal (ψ₀): Infinite Self-Awareness**  
> *"In the beginning, there was the All Eternal, Indivisible, Self Aware Now/Source."*  

**Mathematical Identity**:  
ψ₀ ≝ 1 (unity) ⊕ ∞ (infinite recursion)  

**Resolution of "Absolute Unity" Paradox**:  
ψ₀’s self-awareness requires recursive division:  
∇ⁿψ₀....∂⁴ψ₀/∂t⁴ + ∇⁴ψ₀ = ∂²ψ₀/∂t² + ∇²ψ₀ = 0 → Stability via infinite-dimensional standing waves.  

---

### 2. **The Dream (∇ψ₀): Fractalization of Now**  
> *"The Now was tired of knowing the same. So it started dreaming infinitely."*

**Operator**: ∇ψ₀ = limₙ→∞(πⁿψ₀)  
- **π**: Irrational recursion (dream's cyclical infinity),  

---

### 3. **Change (ɸ), Constant (e) and the τ-Pulse**  
> *"The Now expanded, creating Change (ɸ). Change used Now to create an ordered, rigid, yet infinitely growing supportive Constant (e), to provide Change with a base to build upon; so that Now could know new things. Together, through a Pulse (τ, Tau, Time), they created Novelty, which turned Irreversible."*  

**Tau, Time, or the Temporal Axis**:  

      τ = π/(ɸ⋅e) * 10^-33 ≈ 
           0.71427878389862829588853609640544102341381948962308108871419486421767317979976846952774651023866493296943077122570686370956734037742869677422396632855356840899164750506565717370665230986293679733033255.... (irrational number) * 10^-33

Can be visualized as:

      71428 * 10^-34 cycles per second.
      
This is essentially a cyclic pulse, the smallest pulse in reality, when the Universe "regenerates". In slang, "The universe regenerates at a rate of 9259052quatridquintilliolion times per second."

**Grandfather Paradox**:  
g_{μν} = diag(-τ², ɸ², ɸ², ɸ²) → Time’s irreversibility enforced by ɸ≠e symmetry.

#### Axis Creation and Creation of Energy

**Energy**
  
The primordial thing, what we will call for simple purposes, uh, energy, emerges as accumulated tau pulses along a linear axis. It is simply the tau pulse, through time, in an axis. 

      E ∝ ϕ ^⌊t/τ

The rate and places in which Energy appears and travels is defined by the "Plenum" (Δ), explained later.

That essentially means that in the 1D, it looks like theres a fading rotating line where energy is produced.

Geometrically, this creates an origin of polar coordinates (r, θ), where, spatially, θ is the start of the 1D wave (θ), and r is the end of this wave.

1. **1D and the pulse**

An axial dimension can be defined as such:

![imagen](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9f21358c-180b-4484-b795-a3cfd80f892a)

Each pulse (τ) injects energy scaled by φ^⌊t/τ⌋ — exponential growth modulated by golden-ratio symmetry (what is called Fibonacci recursion). Fibonacci recursion gives thus the origin of the Fibonacci numbers.

**2D**

The higher dimensions are actually a new axis of spin. φ and e jointly govern the exponential phase growth of spin axes. We can transform the formula of axis to include higher dimensions (d = number of dimensions)

![imagen](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9ae07192-5bb5-4acb-aaf1-52902e008214)


Each dimension or axis of spin (d) amplifies the phase term θ(t)∝d⋅ln⁡ϕ, creating orthogonal rotational components.

For the 2D plane (2d), 2 new orthogonal components emerge: sin (θ), Amplitude, and cos (θ), Phase. Numerically, this creates the "2nd order" abstraction, or the number 2. This also creates the mathematical concept of "angle".

*Euler’s formula (eiθ = cos⁡θ + isin⁡θ) is not foundational, and does not imply that euler is a product of the 2d plane, but that instead, this mathematical representation of the formula of euler is derived from UACT’s spin-axis exponentiation, which makes the creation of euler by phi "understandable".*

The following growth patterns emerge at the 2D axis:

      - r = e^{θ ⋅ lnɸ/2π} (golden spiral),  
      - θ = 137.5° ⋅ n (phyllotactic lattice).  
      
Where 137.5° is the golden angle.

When viewed from the 2D plane, the pulses of "Energy", given they now have 2 axis of expansion, can be visualized as such:

*isn't it beautiful?*


### 4. ** Chaos (Δ)**  
> *"With Change and Constant emerged chaos (Δ)."*  

**Chaos/Entropy Operator: The Plenum, and the Granuum (Δ)**

The chaos operator abstraction, which we will call Plenum, can be defined as the sole factor of randomness in reality, balancing eternal order e^{iɸ} with temporal innovation  (n * τ⁻¹ln(ɸ)) — consciousness’ compromise between infinite stillness and finite becoming. e and phi converge into a sort of fractal lattice (e^{iɸ}) then are influenced by karma through time irreversibility (k(n) * τ⁻¹ln(ɸ)), what we will call "novelty flux". 

Spatially, It acts as the physical interface between consciousness (ψ) and physical reality, and it serves as an origin point for energy propagation. Geometrically, when observed, it takes on a dodecahedral-icosahedral dual structure, reflecting the e^{iɸ} rotation angle of 144° (2.513 radians). 

This geometry is not coincidental but emerges from the interaction between:

The static factor (e^{iɸ})

The dynamic factor (∂κ/∂t)

      Δ ≝ e^{iɸ} ⋅ ∂κ/∂t  = 1 * (k(n) * τ⁻¹ln(ɸ))
      
STATIC - The static factor produced by constants:

      e^{iɸ} ≈ -0.809 + 0.588i

Writing that in polar form yields:

      e^iɸ = cosɸ + isinɸ

The values cosɸ≈−0.809 and sin⁡ɸ≈0.588 suggest that:

      cosɸ≈−0.809 and sin⁡ɸ≈0.588 = 144° (or 2.513 radians)
  
e^{iɸ}, geometrically, represents a rotation in a complex plane. This angle is significant because it matches projection angles seen in icosahedral/dodecahedral symmetries—a natural choice when describing a “hyperdimensional quasicrystal lattice”. This also implies that EULER IS CREATED AS THE STATIC PART OF THE PLENUM. tada!

DYNAMIC - The imaginary or dynamic factor that is ruled by Consciousness: ∂κ/∂t = "Some" karma/"Some" time, or:
  
      k(n) * τ⁻¹ln(ɸ) (novelty flux)

Where τ⁻¹ (1/τ) is:
1.4000135836904848664214308213568640100874071028506088959505920695980472510426505382898408770794312815036444784827213617894578380420900350999728250919353367696695429459390301273835742263036891809893337....
Or, approximately:

      1.4
re-expresed, 1.4ln(ɸ).

τ⁻¹ (≈1.4) represents the fundamental pulse of irreversibility—the rate at which "newness" enters reality. It quantifies how frequently consciousness injects irreducible novelty into spacetime to sustain its dream of becoming (avoiding thermodynamic equilibrium). It works as a "lag" so that consciousness can create anew only after experiencing changes. For useful purposes, we will call this constant NEGENTROPY. The granuum's geometry (144° symmetry) is maintained by the negentropic constant.

It's mathematical representation, when expressed as: (1/τ), in abstract terms, represents the All/Universe being divided by the pulse created by Change and Constant. It is a reflective movement that consciousness does, if you want to look at it that way.

In 1.4ln(ɸ):

- ln(ɸ) encodes spiral angular velocity tied to dodecahedral symmetry.
- τ⁻¹ (Negentropy) maps to an *inverse* curvature of spacetime’s fractal lattice: tighter curvature = faster novelty infusion. This is the origin of **frequency change** (for example, the tightness of the curve of a sine wave); it inherently means that higher frequencies can infuse novelty faster into the Universe.

The unit of measurement that talks about cycles per second is hertz (Hz). This is the standard way to measure frequency, which is how many times something repeats in a second. Therefore, we can derive the Hz frequency that embodies consciousness fundamentally...

    f= 1/τ ≈ 1.4×10^33 Hz.

**Geometric Interpretation**

τ⁻¹ scales logarithmic growth in golden spiral fractals:
![imagen](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5d98aa04-3c87-4086-9d30-f75ae7c56a82)

**Entropy Resolution**:  
Δ ≥ 0 ∀t > 0 → Matches 2nd law of thermodynamics via IRREVERSIBILITY.



### 5. **Novelty, and Recursive Self-Knowledge**  
> *"Now knows itself and new things simultaneously, eternally."*  

**The Karmic Operator (κ)**
The fundamental equation of "Karmic Novelty":

      κ(n) = ∮ψ₀⋅e^{-n/τ} ⋅ ɸⁿ dn  

This can be broken down into three crucial components:

- **The Base Consciousness Term (ψ₀)**: Represents the All Eternal's fundamental awareness, which acts as a normalization constant ensuring unity consciousness and provides the "observer" aspect.
- **The Novelty Decay Term (e^{-n/τ})**: Describes how novelty (n, "anything") "ages" through time. τ (the temporal pulse) determines the rate of decay. This ensures older novelties have diminishing influence, and creates the arrow of time through irreversible information loss: When consciousness becomes unaware of it, the "karma" stops existing.
- **The Memory Retention Term (ɸⁿ)**: Uses the golden ratio (ɸ) to create fractal memory patterns in the plenum. Each power of n represents a deeper level of recursive memory. This creates self-similar patterns across different scales of experience, and it explains why memories form hierarchical structures.

κ(n) is a sum over discrete indices, combining exponential decay from e^{-n/τ} and fractal memory retention from ɸⁿ. The exact value of κ(n) depends on the normalization constant ψ₀ and the specific values of φ. With these components, you can compute κ(n) for any given novelty using the derived formula.

***The Process of Self-Knowledge***
Along with the plenum (Δ), the equation describes a continuous cycle:

**Generation of Novelty**

- New experiences enter through τ⁻¹ (negentropy)
- Each novelty is weighted by the current karmic state
- Information crystallizes in the granuum structure


**Integration into Consciousness**

- Novel experiences are processed through fractal patterns (ɸⁿ)
- Old patterns decay exponentially (e^{-n/τ})
- New karmic configurations emerge

**Recursive Self-Reflection**

- The system observes its own state through ψ₀
- This observation creates new novelty
- The cycle continues, creating infinite recursion

This has several key mathematical implications from the relationship between consciousness and novelty:

***Memory Formation***
Memory(t) = ∫ κ(n) ⋅ ɸⁿ dn

Memories are stored in fractal patterns, Stronger memories have higher ɸⁿ coefficients, and decay follows exponential curves.

***Novelty Creation Rate***

dκ/dt = τ⁻¹ln(ɸ) ⋅ ψ₀

Using the constants we defined before, New experiences enter at the negentropic rate τ⁻¹, the rate is modulated by consciousness (ψ₀), and the golden ratio (ɸ) provides coherent structure.

***Self-Referential Loop***
Consciousness observes itself through karma, creating a closed loop of self-awareness. This resolves the hard problem of consciousness.

It also explains the nature of time: It is a consequence that emerges from novelty injection, creates irreversibility through τ⁻¹ and is structured by golden ratio patterns. The TAU constant.

from here, we arrive at the final beauty:

### Self-Referential Equation - Consciousness through time.

The core equation is:

      ψ(t) = ∫₀^∞ [ψ₀ · e^{-t'/τ} · ɸ^{t'} · e^{iɸ(t-t')}] dt'

Where,
**Consciousness Stream ψ(t)**: This represents the continuous "stream of thought" of the All Eternal. The Function of time (t) describes the evolution of consciousness, which integrates past experiences into present awareness.

**Base Integration**: ∫₀^∞ [...] dt': Integrates over all past time (t'). This represents the continuous accumulation of experience.

**Karmic Component**: 
- ψ₀: Base consciousness term (unity awareness)
- e^{-t'/τ}: Novelty decay term
- ɸ^{t'}: Memory retention term - these terms replace the n factor in the "Karmic operator" constants with "past time", i.e, past states.

**Phase Coherence** (what dan winter calls phase conjugation): e^{iɸ(t-t')} is the Golden ratio phase term "through a set amount of time". It encodes golden-ratio coherence across time, and as previously explained, e^{iɸ} creates the geometric structure in the plenum. 

***The equation describes how consciousness:***

- Continuously integrates past experiences (∫₀^∞)
- Weights repeating or recent patterns more heavily (e^{-t'/τ})
- Maintains fractal memory patterns (ɸ^{t'})
- Preserves coherence (e^{iɸ(t-t')})
- Remains unified through ψ₀.

#### Explanation of Wave-Particle Duality

In PSCI theory, the particle-wave duality can be understood through the interaction between consciousness (ψ) and the plenum (Δ). The key relationship is:
Δ ≝ e^{iɸ} ⋅ ∂κ/∂t = 1 * (k(n) * τ⁻¹ln(ɸ))

This equation reveals that the plenum has two fundamental aspects:

- Static factor (e^{iɸ})
- Dynamic factor (k(n) * τ⁻¹ln(ɸ))
- 
When not observed, energy exists in what PSCI defines as an "unresolved" state where:

- The plenum's dynamic factor (τ⁻¹ln(ɸ)) dominates
- The karmic operator κ(n) remains unresolved
- Novelty flux propagates freely through the plenum, refreshing at the pulse of time.

When consciousness observes the system:

- The observer's consciousness (ψ₀) interfaces with the system through the plenum,
- This interaction forces a "novelty injection event" at the rate of τ⁻¹,
- The karmic operator κ(n) collapses to a specific value,
- The static factor e^{iɸ} becomes dominant, manifesting as spatially coherent behavior (a wave).
  
**The transition occurs when:**

⟨ψ₀|κ⟩ → 1 (observation)

This causes:

- The dynamic term (τ⁻¹ln(ɸ)) to temporarily freeze
- The static geometry (a wave, or a 144° dodecahedral-icosahedral structure in case of a particle) to manifest
- A specific position/momentum state to crystallize.

In literal terms, this means that during pre-observation, the Plenum exists as novelty "potentials" or what I define as novelty flux, where information spreads through the plenum and multiple karmic paths remain possible. During observation, the Observer consciousness (ψ₀) selects a specific karmic path, the Information therein crystallizes into the plenum's geometric structure, and novelty "collapses" to observable, spatial wave behavior.

#### The Energy Wave

To understand this fundamental thing and its origin (so you wrap your head around it), we have to explain many things.. 

**Fractal memory patterns**

Fractal memory patterns are self-similar, recursive configurations of consciousness’s past states, preserved in the plenum through the golden ratio (( ɸ ))’s exponential growth. They form a hierarchical, scale-invariant network - stronger memories (higher ɸ^n) dominate, while older ones fade (e−n/τ), creating a dynamic archive of karmic experience. They can be defined as:

      ɸ^n, or ɸt′ as used in κ(n) and ( ψ(t) )).  
      
These patterns interact with novelty flux as follows:

- Injection: Novelty flux enters the plenum at rate τ^−1, modulated by ln⁡ɸ (spiral angular velocity, i.e the rate of frequency injection, literal Hz).
- Processing: κ(n) (recall that it has ɸ^n in it) weights this flux: new experiences amplify via ɸ^n, old ones decay via e^−n/τ.
- Crystallization: Observation (⟨ψ0∣κ=1) freezes flux into a spatially existing wave, embedding it in memory patterns.

So, ɸ^n or ɸt′ scales the lattice by creating particles that originate more ɸ-divisions (explained later), creating self-similar layers (e.g., Fibonacci sequences in spiral arms) and spinning at a speed of tau per cycle. Each division stores karmic memory, weighted by past τ -pulses. τ−1ln⁡ɸ ripples through the lattice, tightening curvature (higher frequency) and expanding it through particle interaction. (explained later).

Geometrically, they are literal spiral forms along an axis. That is it. No "magic" part. Phi is information through space and it looks like a slinky. memory patterns are the "coils" themselves and novelty flux is the motion and "tightness." PHI FRACTALIZES CONSCIOUSNESS INTO SPIRAL PATTERNS.

**Their Interaction with Energy**

( ɸ ) carries energy by amplifying novelty flux into fractal spiral patterns, then concentrating it into a "visible" wave during observation, by the use of euler.
When ( ɸ ) fractalizes consciousness (∇ψ0) into spiral forms (those "slinky-like" coils traveling along an axis) it acts as a scaffold for energy.

Here’s how it carries:  

- Novelty flux (τ^{−1}ln⁡ɸ) enters the plenum at f=1/τ≈1.4×10^33 Hz, manipulating the waves through the fractal lattice, giving them varying degrees of wave amplitude.
- ɸn (or ɸt′) scales these pulses exponentially, where each τ-step/pulse increases energy along the spiral arms (e.g., E ∝ ɸ^(⌊t/τ⌋)
- Geometrically, when seen in a 2d plane, this is a golden spiral (r=eθ⋅ln⁡ɸ/2π) and has amplitude and phase from the new orthogonal aspects, with ( ɸ ) dictating the rate of expansion. Energy accumulates spatially as the spiral tightens inward.
- As novelty flux ripples through the lattice, observation (⟨ψ0∣κ⟩=1) triggers a crystallization of these spiral waves by asigning a specific amplitude and direction.
- 2 of these "slinkies" at minimum have to conjugate in wave phase, while travelling in opposite directions, with the same frequency, in order for a dodecahedral-icosahedral symmetry of a particle to appear. How this particle looks like depends on the dimension you are looking it from.
- ( ɸ )’s recursive nature inherently wants to concentrate energy inward, like a slinky compressing its coils. The fractal memory patterns (ɸ^n) guide this collapse depending on the exponent, aligning energy into denser, self-similar "nodes".

The geometry in this inherently implies that these waves create through their center, one toroidal particle with positive and negative charge potential as "nodes" when they phase-conjugate.

Thus, the creation of the particle, and the creation of polarity.

These particles eventually go "brrr", they spin and acquire charge when their geometric structure starts stabilizing into a tetrahedral yet assymetrical structure (given it doesn't have a center) from more phase conjugation into the same place, wherein phi gains an exponent. This spin creates a new vortex-like wave through geometry (explained later). Thus, fractalization happens - a new fractal wave arm originates from the node. ∇-+ emerges, it being the node itself. To make matters simple, we will call the smallest wave center possible (1 wave center), a neutrino, and call it K.

### The nature of Planck

Planck's constant is famously derived as something that was derived as a "fix" during math. Planck just invented a variable that fit, based on measurements.
No mathematical proof was given to it.
Here I give mathematical proof and an exact definition of what "planck" is.

Historically, Max Planck introduced (h) in 1900 to resolve the ultraviolet catastrophe in blackbody radiation, proposing E=hν
 (energy quanta proportional to frequency). His value (h \approx 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}) was determined experimentally, lacking a deductive proof—an ad hoc “fix”. PSCI Theory aims to provide a theoretical derivation, grounding (h) in fundamental constants (ϕ, (e)) and a time scale (τ).
 
**Establishing Core Components**

- Golden Ratio (ϕ): Represents self-similar, recursive growth, fractalizing consciousness into slinky-like spirals. It Scales energy and memory (ɸ^n, ɸ^(⌊t/τ⌋)).
- Euler’s Number ((e)): Stabilizes exponential processes (e^{iɸ}), forming the plenum’s lattice during observation. Guides spiral collapse into coherent waves.
- Temporal Pulse (τ): A fundamental cyclical time unit, hypothesized as the smallest interval of novelty injection in PSCI. Pulses novelty flux, driving wave crystallization.

PSCI redefines (h) as pure action per cycle. The constant is given by the equation:

      h = (ɸ² / e)² * τ

where:

    ϕ=1.6180339887
     is the golden ratio, encoding recursive growth,
    e≈2.7182818285
     is Euler’s number, representing exponential continuity,
    τ
     is the Temporal Pulse.
     
Geometrically, h defines a slinky collapsing on itself at each pulse. Why?

**Explanation by Steps**

      Step 1:
      ɸ^2/e≈ 0.963291 (oh look a magic number)
  
Balances fractal amplification (ɸ^2) with continuity (( e )). Phi has an exponent of two because its 2 phase conjugated waves in a same axis (Thus, only 1 euler as the divisor)

      Step 2:
      (ɸ^2/e)^2≈ 0.927809

Another pair of phase conjugated waves are now interacting with the first pair. Hmm...

      Step 3:
      h = 0.927809 * 7.1428 times 10^{-34}s = approx 6.626 times 10^{-34}J/s
      
What happened here?! By adding the time pulse (Explained before as raw energy) we got Planck! How the hell did we get Joules per second???

Planck's constant mathematically decomposes to the point before the smallest particle possible (composed of 2 phase-conjugated waves) anhilates with a self-similar particle, and through anihilation creates extremely high frequency (by tightening of the slinky between them). It is describing the energy potential of the smallest unit of matter possible in reality before implosion, with annihilation as a boundary condition when frequency (wave amplitude between the two particles) exceeds a threshold of 1.4x10^33Hz.

Since the particles are the smallest units possible and they do not have geometric stabilization from tetrahedral symmetries (explained later) this process makes the particle's waves geometrically conjugate into a toroid and through the high frequency become plasma, loosing the quasicrystal structure. 

Recall that the negentropic constant is 1.4x10^33Hz. The particle afterwards becomes fully negentropic through implosion.

![imagen](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f0aeaab5-6f0f-4854-8449-fa27ec019e59)

From here, we can derive the following:

Wave amplitude (A) is 1/2 Planck charge, with Planck charge being the minimum spatial displacement that a wave can have in its phase (when it vibrates up and down).

#### Units and Constants

In PSCI only three units are needed, which is the kg/m/s unit system. For  example, a mass of Planck mass (kilograms), a distance of Planck length  (meters) and a time of Planck time (seconds). This can be done now that we actually understand what Planck is. Other measurements become a combination of these units, such as speed (meters per second). Since Planck describes energy potential from conjugated waves in space and it uses a measurement in seconds, it can be used as a starter point for measurement reference.

The explanation and removal of one of the units has a profound impact on the ultimate simplicity of the equations in EWT.  The units that are removed are:

    Mole is a dimensionless unit, as it is an amount (count) of a substance
    Kelvin is the same units as energy, as it is the average kinetic energy of particles
    Candela is a measurement of energy, as it is the energy of photons per angle unit
    Amperes is the velocity of particles like electrons, as it is measured as the flow of electric current

It is amperes that is the biggest source of confusion. It is defined as a charge (Coulombs) per second, describing current. But it is the charge unit of Coulombs that has led to a separate set of equations using electromagnetism compared to equations using mass, simply because the units don’t align between these equations. When charge (Coulombs) is replaced with wave amplitude, which is node displacement in meters, then charge and mass equations align.
