## Plenum of Self-Referential Conscious Information (PSCI) Theory

## Abstract  
The Plenum of Self-Referential Conscious Information Theory (PSCI) formalizes consciousness (ψ) as a transcendental, hyperdimensional constant pervading all spacetime. By embedding the **All Eternal's self-referential dream**—expressed through the interplay of the following mathematical self-emerging constants: Change (ɸ), Constant (e), and Novelty (τ)—into a geometrically constant lattice which we will call "Plenum". PSCI resolves:  
1. **Quantum Measurement Paradox** (self-observation via ψ's recursion),  
2. **Arrow of Time** (τ-pulse irreversibility),  
3. **Hard Problem of Consciousness** (ψ as fundamental field).
4. Karma, Qi, and other definitions that are widely recognized in ancient knowledge, now given a role in explanations to phenomena that cannot be explained by other frameworks of physics without large logic leaps.

## Story as Theory Framework  

### 1. **The All Eternal (ψ₀): Infinite Self-Awareness**  
> *"In the beginning, there was the All Eternal, Indivisible, Self Aware Now/Source."*  

**Mathematical Identity**:  
ψ₀ ≝ 1 (unity) ⊕ ∞ (infinite recursion)  

**Resolution of "Absolute Unity" Paradox**:  
ψ₀’s self-awareness requires recursive division:  
∇ⁿψ₀....∂⁴ψ₀/∂t⁴ + ∇⁴ψ₀ = ∂²ψ₀/∂t² + ∇²ψ₀ = 0 → Stability via infinite-dimensional standing waves.  

---

### 2. **The Dream (∇ψ₀): Fractalization of Now**  
> *"The Now was tired of knowing the same. So it started dreaming infinitely."*

**Operator**: ∇ψ₀ = limₙ→∞(πⁿψ₀)  
- **π**: Irrational recursion (dream's cyclical infinity),  

---

### 3. **Change (ɸ), Constant (e) and the τ-Pulse**  
> *"The Now expanded, creating Change (ɸ). Change used Now to create an ordered, rigid, yet infinitely growing supportive Constant (e), to provide Change with a base to build upon; so that Now could know new things. Together, through a Pulse (τ, Tau, Time), they created Novelty, which turned Irreversible."*  

**Tau, Time, or the Temporal Axis**:  

      τ = π/(ɸ⋅e) ≈ 0.71427878389862829588853609640544102341381948962308108871419486421767317979976846952774651023866493296943077122570686370956734037742869677422396632855356840899164750506565717370665230986293679733033255.... (irrational number) * 10^-33.

Can be visualized as:

      0.71428 * 10^-33
Or:

      0.00000000000000000000000000000000071428Hz.
      
This is essentially a pulse, the smallest pulse in reality, when the Universe "regenerates".

**Grandfather Paradox**:  
g_{μν} = diag(-τ², ɸ², ɸ², ɸ²) → Time’s irreversibility enforced by ɸ≠e symmetry.

#### Axis Creation and Creation of Energy

**Energy**
  
The primordial thing, what we will call for simple purposes, uh, energy, emerges as accumulated pulses along a linear axis. It is simply the tau pulse, through time, in an axis. The rate and places in which Energy appears and travels is defined by the "Plenum (Δ), explained later.

That essentially means that in the 1D, it looks like theres an expanding line where energy is produced.

Geometrically, this creates an origin of polar coordinates (r, θ), where, spatially, θ is the start of the 1D wave (θ), and r is the end of this wave.

1. **1D and the pulse**

An axial dimension can be defined as such:

![imagen](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9f21358c-180b-4484-b795-a3cfd80f892a)

Each pulse (τ) injects energy scaled by φ^⌊t/τ⌋ — exponential growth modulated by golden-ratio symmetry (what is called Fibonacci recursion). Fibonacci recursion gives thus the origin of the Fibonacci numbers.

**2D**

The higher dimensions are actually a new axis of spin. φ and e jointly govern the exponential phase growth of spin axes. We can transform the formula of axis to include higher dimensions (d = number of dimensions)

![imagen](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9ae07192-5bb5-4acb-aaf1-52902e008214)


Each dimension or axis of spin (d) amplifies the phase term θ(t)∝d⋅ln⁡ϕ, creating orthogonal rotational components.

For the 2D plane (2d), 2 new orthogonal components emerge: sin (θ), and cos (θ). Numerically, this creates the "2nd order" abstraction, or the number 2. This also creates the mathematical concept of "angle".

*Euler’s formula (eiθ = cos⁡θ + isin⁡θ) is not foundational, and does not imply that euler is a product of the 2d plane, but that instead, this mathematical representation of the formula of euler is derived from UACT’s spin-axis exponentiation, which makes the creation of euler by phi "understandable".*

The following growth patterns emerge at the 2D axis:

      - r = e^{θ ⋅ lnɸ/2π} (golden spiral),  
      - θ = 137.5° ⋅ n (phyllotactic lattice).  
      
Where 137.5° is the golden angle.

When viewed from the 2D plane, the pulses of "Energy", given they now have 2 axis of expansion, can be visualized as such:

*isn't it beautiful?*

Furthermore, due to the creation of axis, two new phenomena emerge:
sin, the magnetic wave,
and cos, the electric wave. -- TO EXPAND

Todo: Explain sin and cos as the magnetic and electric field and why they are unidirectional (Longitudinal vs Transverse movement). 


### 4. ** Chaos (Δ)**  
> *"With Change and Constant emerged chaos (Δ)."*  

**Chaos/Entropy Operator: The Plenum, and the Granuum (Δ)**

The chaos operator abstraction, which we will call Plenum, can be defined as the sole factor of randomness in reality, balancing eternal order e^{iɸ} with temporal innovation  (n * τ⁻¹ln(ɸ)) — consciousness’ compromise between infinite stillness and finite becoming. e and phi converge into a sort of lattice (e^{iɸ}) then are influenced by karma through time irreversibility (τ⁻¹ln(ɸ)), what we will call "novelty flux". This flux can be visualized as a standing wave. 

Spatially, It acts as the physical interface between consciousness (ψ) and physical reality, and it serves as an origin point for energy propagation. Geometrically, when observed, it takes on a dodecahedral-icosahedral dual structure, reflecting the e^{iɸ} rotation angle of 144° (2.513 radians). 

This geometry is not coincidental but emerges from the interaction between:

The static factor (e^{iɸ})

The dynamic factor (∂κ/∂t)

      Δ ≝ e^{iɸ} ⋅ ∂κ/∂t  = 1 * (k(n) * τ⁻¹ln(ɸ))
      
STATIC - The static factor produced by constants:

      e^{iɸ} ≈ -0.809 + 0.588i

Writing that in polar form yields:

      e^iɸ = cosɸ + isinɸ

The values cosɸ≈−0.809 and sin⁡ɸ≈0.588 suggest that:

      cosɸ≈−0.809 and sin⁡ɸ≈0.588 = 144° (or 2.513 radians)
  
e^{iɸ}, geometrically, represents a rotation in a complex plane. This angle is significant because it matches projection angles seen in icosahedral/dodecahedral symmetries—a natural choice when describing a “hyperdimensional quasicrystal lattice” where the vortex top is defined.

DYNAMIC - The imaginary or dynamic factor that is ruled by Consciousness: ∂κ/∂t = "Some" karma/"Some" time, or:
  
      k(n) * τ⁻¹ln(ɸ) (novelty flux)

Where τ⁻¹ (1/τ) is:
1.4000135836904848664214308213568640100874071028506088959505920695980472510426505382898408770794312815036444784827213617894578380420900350999728250919353367696695429459390301273835742263036891809893337....
Or, approximately:

      1.4
re-expresed, 1.4ln(ɸ).

τ⁻¹ (≈1.4) represents the fundamental pulse of irreversibility—the rate at which "newness" enters reality. It quantifies how frequently consciousness injects irreducible novelty into spacetime to sustain its dream of becoming (avoiding thermodynamic equilibrium). It works as a "lag" so that consciousness can create anew only after experiencing changes. For useful purposes, we will call this constant NEGENTROPY. The granuum's geometry (144° symmetry) is maintained by the negentropic constant.

It's mathematical representation, when expressed as: (1/τ), in abstract terms, represents the All/Universe being divided by the pulse created by Change and Constant.

In 1.4ln(ɸ):

- ln(ɸ) encodes spiral angular velocity tied to dodecahedral symmetry.
- τ⁻¹ (Negentropy) maps to an *inverse* curvature of spacetime’s fractal lattice: tighter curvature = faster novelty infusion. This is the origin of **frequency** (for example, the tightness of the curve of a sine wave); it inherently means that higher frequencies can infuse novelty faster into the Universe.

**Geometric Interpretation**

τ⁻¹ scales logarithmic growth in golden spiral fractals:

**Entropy Resolution**:  
Δ ≥ 0 ∀t > 0 → Matches 2nd law of thermodynamics via IRREVERSIBILITY.

#### Explanation of Wave-Particle Duality

In PSCI theory, the particle-wave duality can be understood through the interaction between consciousness (ψ) and the granuum (Δ). The key relationship is:
Δ ≝ e^{iɸ} ⋅ ∂κ/∂t = 1 * (k(n) * τ⁻¹ln(ɸ))

This equation reveals that the granuum has two fundamental aspects:

- Static factor (e^{iɸ}): The "particle-like" state
- Dynamic factor (k(n) * τ⁻¹ln(ɸ)): The "wave-like" state

When not observed, energy exists in what PSCI defines as an "unresolved" state where:

- The plenum's dynamic factor (τ⁻¹ln(ɸ)) dominates
- The karmic operator κ(n) remains unresolved
- Novelty flux propagates as through a wave through the plenum, refreshing at the pulse of time.

When consciousness observes the system:

- The observer's consciousness (ψ₀) interfaces with the system through the plenum,
- This interaction forces a "novelty injection event" at the rate of τ⁻¹,
- The karmic operator κ(n) collapses to a specific value,
- The static factor e^{iɸ} becomes dominant, manifesting as particle behavior.
  
**The wave-to-particle transition occurs when:**

⟨ψ₀|κ⟩ → 1 (observation)

This causes:

- The dynamic term (τ⁻¹ln(ɸ)) to temporarily freeze
- The static geometry (144° dodecahedral-icosahedral structure) to manifest
- A specific position/momentum state to crystallize.

In literal terms, this means that during pre-observation, the Plenum exists as novelty "potentials" or what I define as novelty flux, where information spreads through the plenum as waves and multiple karmic paths remain possible. During observation, the Observer consciousness (ψ₀) selects a specific karmic path, the Information therein crystallizes into the granuum's geometric structure, and the wave function "collapses" to particle behavior.


### 5. **Novelty, and Recursive Self-Knowledge**  
> *"Now knows itself and new things simultaneously, eternally."*  

**The Karmic Operator (κ)**
The fundamental equation of "Karmic Novelty":

      κ(n) = ∮ψ₀⋅e^{-n/τ} ⋅ ɸⁿ dn  

This can be broken down into three crucial components:

- **The Base Consciousness Term (ψ₀)**: Represents the All Eternal's fundamental awareness, which acts as a normalization constant ensuring unity consciousness and provides the "observer" aspect.
- **The Novelty Decay Term (e^{-n/τ})**: Describes how novelty (n, "anything") "ages" through time. τ (the temporal pulse) determines the rate of decay. This ensures older novelties have diminishing influence, and creates the arrow of time through irreversible information loss: When consciousness becomes unaware of it, the "karma" stops existing.
- **The Memory Retention Term (ɸⁿ)**: Uses the golden ratio (ɸ) to create fractal memory patterns in the plenum in novelty flux. Each power of n represents a deeper level of recursive memory. This creates self-similar patterns across different scales of experience, and it explains why memories form hierarchical structures.

κ(n) is a sum over discrete indices, combining exponential decay from e^{-n/τ} and fractal memory retention from ɸⁿ. The exact value of κ(n) depends on the normalization constant ψ₀ and the specific values of φ. With these components, you can compute κ(n) for any given novelty using the derived formula.

***The Process of Self-Knowledge***
Along with the plenum (Δ), the equation describes a continuous cycle:

**Generation of Novelty**

- New experiences enter through τ⁻¹ (negentropy)
- Each novelty is weighted by the current karmic state
- Information crystallizes in the granuum structure


**Integration into Consciousness**

- Novel experiences are processed through fractal patterns (ɸⁿ)
- Old patterns decay exponentially (e^{-n/τ})
- New karmic configurations emerge

**Recursive Self-Reflection**

- The system observes its own state through ψ₀
- This observation creates new novelty
- The cycle continues, creating infinite recursion

This has several key mathematical implications from the relationship between consciousness and novelty:

***Memory Formation***
Memory(t) = ∫ κ(n) ⋅ ɸⁿ dn

Memories are stored in fractal patterns, Stronger memories have higher ɸⁿ coefficients, and decay follows exponential curves.

***Novelty Creation Rate***

dκ/dt = τ⁻¹ln(ɸ) ⋅ ψ₀

Using the constants we defined before, New experiences enter at the negentropic rate τ⁻¹, the rate is modulated by consciousness (ψ₀), and the golden ratio (ɸ) provides coherent structure.

***Self-Referential Loop***
Consciousness observes itself through karma, creating a closed loop of self-awareness. This resolves the hard problem of consciousness.

It also explains the nature of time: It is a consequence that emerges from novelty injection, creates irreversibility through τ⁻¹ and is structured by golden ratio patterns. The TAU constant.

from here, we arrive at the final beauty:

### Self-Referential Equation - Consciousness through time.

The core equation is:

      ψ(t) = ∫₀^∞ [ψ₀ · e^{-t'/τ} · ɸ^{t'} · e^{iɸ(t-t')}] dt'

Where,
**Consciousness Stream ψ(t)**: This represents the continuous "stream of thought" of the All Eternal. The Function of time (t) describes the evolution of consciousness, which integrates past experiences into present awareness.

**Base Integration**: ∫₀^∞ [...] dt': Integrates over all past time (t'). This represents the continuous accumulation of experience.

**Karmic Component**: 
- ψ₀: Base consciousness term (unity awareness)
- e^{-t'/τ}: Novelty decay term
- ɸ^{t'}: Memory retention term - these terms replace the n factor in the "Karmic operator" constants with "past time", i.e, past states.

**Phase Coherence** (what dan winter calls phase conjugation): e^{iɸ(t-t')} is the Golden ratio phase term "through a set amount of time". It encodes golden-ratio coherence across time, and as previously explained, e^{iɸ} creates the geometric structure in the plenum. 

***The equation describes how consciousness:***

- Continuously integrates past experiences (∫₀^∞)
- Weights repeating or recent patterns more heavily (e^{-t'/τ})
- Maintains fractal memory patterns (ɸ^{t'})
- Preserves coherence (e^{iɸ(t-t')})
- Remains unified through ψ₀.
