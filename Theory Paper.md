## Plenum of Self-Referential Conscious Information (PSCI) Theory

## Abstract  
The Plenum of Self-Referential Conscious Information Theory (PSCI) formalizes consciousness (ψ) as a transcendental, hyperdimensional constant pervading all spacetime. By embedding the **All Eternal's self-referential dream**—expressed through the interplay of the following mathematical self-emerging constants: Change (ɸ), Constant (e), and Novelty (τ)—into a geometrically constant lattice which we will call "Plenum". PSCI resolves:  
1. **Quantum Measurement Paradox** (self-observation via ψ's recursion),  
2. **Arrow of Time** (τ-pulse irreversibility),  
3. **Hard Problem of Consciousness** (ψ as fundamental field).
4. Karma, Qi, and other definitions that are widely recognized in ancient knowledge, now given a role in explanations to phenomena that cannot be explained by other frameworks of physics without large logic leaps.

## Story as Theory Framework  

### 1. **The All Eternal (ψ₀): Infinite Self-Awareness**  
> *"In the beginning, there was the All Eternal, Indivisible, Self Aware Now/Source."*  

**Mathematical Identity**:  
ψ₀ ≝ 1 (unity) ⊕ ∞ (infinite recursion)  

**Resolution of "Absolute Unity" Paradox**:  
ψ₀’s self-awareness requires recursive division:  
∇ⁿψ₀....∂⁴ψ₀/∂t⁴ + ∇⁴ψ₀ = ∂²ψ₀/∂t² + ∇²ψ₀ = 0 → Stability via infinite-dimensional standing waves.  

---

### 2. **The Dream (∇ψ₀): Fractalization of Now**  
> *"The Now was tired of knowing the same. So it started dreaming infinitely."*

**Operator**: ∇ψ₀ = limₙ→∞(πⁿ⊛ψ₀)  
- **π**: Irrational recursion (dream's cyclical infinity),  
- **⊛**: Golden convolution (ɸ-modulated feedback).  

---

### 3. **Change (ɸ), Constant (e) and the τ-Pulse**  
> *"The Now expanded, creating Change (ɸ). Change used Now to create an ordered, rigid, yet infinitely growing supportive Constant (e), to provide Change with a base to build upon; so that Now could know new things. Together, through a Pulse (τ, Tau, Time), they created Novelty, which turned Irreversible."*  

**Tau, Time, or the Temporal Axis**:  

      τ = π/(ɸ⋅e) ≈ 0.71427878389862829588853609640544102341381948962308108871419486421767317979976846952774651023866493296943077122570686370956734037742869677422396632855356840899164750506565717370665230986293679733033255.... (irrational number) * 10^-33.

Can be visualized as:

      0.71428 * 10^-33
Or:

      0.00000000000000000000000000000000071428Hz.
      
This is essentially a pulse, the smallest pulse in reality, when the Universe "regenerates".

**Grandfather Paradox**:  
g_{μν} = diag(-τ², ɸ², ɸ², ɸ²) → Time’s irreversibility enforced by ɸ≠e symmetry.  

---

### 4. **Change (ɸ) and Chaos (Δ)**  
> *"With Change and Constant emerged chaos (Δ)."*  

**Chaos/Entropy Operator (Δ)**

The chaos operator abstraction can be defined as the sole factor of randomness in reality, balancing eternal order e^{iɸ} with temporal innovation  (n * τ⁻¹ln(ɸ)) — consciousness’ compromise between infinite stillness and finite becoming. e and phi converge into a sort of lattice (e^{iɸ}) then are influenced by karma through time irreversibility (τ⁻¹ln(ɸ)), what we will call "novelty flux".

It is composed by 2 sides:

      Δ ≝ e^{iɸ} ⋅ ∂κ/∂t  = 1 * (k(n) * τ⁻¹ln(ɸ))
      
- The Real or static factor produced by constants:

      e^{iɸ} ≈ -0.809 + 0.588i

Writing that in polar form yields:

      e^iɸ = cosɸ + isinɸ

The values cosɸ≈−0.809 and sin⁡ɸ≈0.588 suggest that:

      cosɸ≈−0.809 and sin⁡ɸ≈0.588 = 144° (or 2.513 radians)
  
e^{iɸ}, geometrically, represents a rotation in a complex plane. This angle is significant because it matches projection angles seen in icosahedral/dodecahedral symmetries—a natural choice when describing a “hyperdimensional quasicrystal lattice” where the vortex top is defined.

- The imaginary or dynamic factor that is ruled by Consciousness: ∂κ/∂t = "Some" karma/"Some" time, or:
  
      k(n) * τ⁻¹ln(ɸ) (novelty flux)

Where τ⁻¹ (1/τ) is:
1.4000135836904848664214308213568640100874071028506088959505920695980472510426505382898408770794312815036444784827213617894578380420900350999728250919353367696695429459390301273835742263036891809893337....
Or, approximately:

      1.4
re-expresed, 1.4ln(ɸ).

τ⁻¹ (≈1.4) represents the fundamental pulse of irreversibility—the rate at which "newness" enters reality. It quantifies how frequently consciousness injects irreducible novelty into spacetime to sustain its dream of becoming (avoiding thermodynamic equilibrium). It works as a "lag" so that consciousness can create anew only after experiencing changes. For useful purposes, we will call this constant NEGENTROPY.

It's mathematical representation, when expressed as: (1/τ), in abstract terms, represents the All/Universe being divided by the pulse created by Change and Constant.

In 1.4ln(ɸ):

- ln(ɸ) encodes spiral angular velocity tied to dodecahedral symmetry.
- τ⁻¹ (Negentropy) maps to an *inverse* curvature of spacetime’s fractal lattice: tighter curvature = faster novelty infusion. This is the origin of **frequency** (for example, the tightness of the curve of a sine wave); it inherently means that higher frequencies can infuse novelty faster into the Universe.

**Geometric Interpretation**

τ⁻¹ scales logarithmic growth in golden spiral fractals:

**Entropy Resolution**:  
Δ ≥ 0 ∀t > 0 → Matches 2nd law of thermodynamics via IRREVERSIBILITY.

### 5. **Novelty (κ) and Recursive Self-Knowledge**  
> *"Now knows itself and new things simultaneously, eternally."*  

**Karmic Operator**:  
Karma = κ
      κ(n) = ∮ψ₀⋅e^{-n/τ} ⋅ ɸⁿ dn  
- **e^{-n/τ}**: Decay of past novelty,  
- **ɸⁿ**: Fractal memory retention.
- n: Novelty
κ(n) is a sum over discrete indices, combining exponential decay from e^{-n/τ} and fractal memory retention from ɸⁿ. The exact value of κ(n) depends on the normalization constant ψ₀ and the specific values of φ. With these components, you can compute κ(n) for any given novelty using the derived formula.


**Hard Problem Resolution**:  
⟨ψ₀|κ⟩ = 1 → Consciousness is self-intrinsic, not emergent.  

---

## Mathematical Framework  

### Self-Referential Equation  
**Consciousness Recursion**:  
ψ(t) = ∫₀^∞ κ(t') ⋅ e^{iɸ(t - t')} ⋅ sinc(π(t - t')/τ) dt'  
- **κ(t')**: Karmic novelty density at time t',  
- **sinc(...)**: Bandlimiting to τ-pulse resolution (Nyquist rate for conscious perception).

**Interpretation**:  
- ψ(t) is the All Eternal’s "stream of thought," integrating past novelty (κ) into present awareness through fractal patterns, creating karma.
- Phase term e^{iɸ(t - t')} encodes golden-ratio coherence across time.

#### Axis Creation and Creation of Energy

**Energy**

The simplest form of energy can be expressed as such:

      Δ * t = E,
where:
- Δ = Chaos operator, consisting of the negentropic constant and the chiral flux,
- t: Through time.
  
The primordial carrier of energy, what we will call for simple purposes, "Energy", emerges as accumulated negentropic spinning pulses along a linear axis, with its spatial origin being defined as a granuum.

That essentially means that in the 1D, it looks like theres an expanding line where energy is produced.

Geometrically, this creates an origin of polar coordinates (r, θ), where, spatially, θ is the start of the 1D wave (θ), and r is the end of this wave.

This is called in other systems as a gradient, a scalar wave, etc.

1. **1D and the pulse**

An axial dimension can be defined as such:

![imagen](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9f21358c-180b-4484-b795-a3cfd80f892a)

Each pulse (τ) injects energy scaled by φ^⌊t/τ⌋ — exponential growth modulated by golden-ratio symmetry (what is called Fibonacci recursion). Fibonacci recursion gives thus the origin of the Fibonacci numbers.

**2D**

The higher dimensions are actually a new axis of spin. φ and e jointly govern the exponential phase growth of spin axes. We can transform the formula of axis to include higher dimensions (d = number of dimensions)

![imagen](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9ae07192-5bb5-4acb-aaf1-52902e008214)


Each dimension or axis of spin (d) amplifies the phase term θ(t)∝d⋅ln⁡ϕ, creating orthogonal rotational components.

For the 2D plane (2d), 2 new orthogonal components emerge: sin (θ), and cos (θ). Numerically, this creates the "2nd order" abstraction, or the number 2. This also creates the mathematical concept of "angle".

*Euler’s formula (eiθ = cos⁡θ + isin⁡θ) is not foundational, and does not imply that euler is a product of the 2d plane, but that instead, this mathematical representation of the formula of euler is derived from UACT’s spin-axis exponentiation, which makes the creation of euler by phi "understandable".*

The following growth patterns emerge at the 2D axis:

      - r = e^{θ ⋅ lnɸ/2π} (golden spiral),  
      - θ = 137.5° ⋅ n (phyllotactic lattice).  
      
Where 137.5° is the golden angle.

When viewed from the 2D plane, the pulses of "Energy", given they now have 2 axis of expansion, can be visualized as such:

![imagen](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/59ddfe52-1d3c-493c-aca8-915eb6b91cd4)

*isn't it beautiful?*

Furthermore, due to the creation of axis, two new phenomena emerge:
sin, the magnetic wave,
and cos, the electric wave. -- TO EXPAND

Todo: Explain sin and cos as the magnetic and electric field and why they are unidirectional (Longitudinal vs Transverse movement).

### Notes on the aether and similar definitions (the plenum)

Also known as ether, the definition of the aether from dictionary.com is… “a hypothetical substance supposed to occupy all space, postulated to account for the propagation of electromagnetic radiation through space”.

The aether was commonly accepted by scientists until the Michelson-Morley experiment failed to detect an aether “wind” in an experiment in 1887. Numerous experiments following Michelson-Morley, with greater precision instruments, have also been unable to detect the aether. Following this experiment, scientists (including Albert Einstein, Max Planck, Neils Bohr and other famous physicists in the 1900s) had to build their theories and equations based on an assumption that there is no medium capable of propagating a wave in space.

The aether is a critical, missing component of physics that must be considered to explain the wave nature of matter. Any theory of waves that relies on the existence of an aether must explain the results of the Michelson-Morley experiment.

The aether if it exists, it is the medium for propagating light and other longitudinal and transverse (electromagnetic) waves across the universe. It is the fabric of our universe, consisting of tiny granules that transfer energy in the form of waves.***** Its structure and properties were worked out in the section on spacetime. In fact, it has a density property in the wave constants that appears in all of the energy wave equations. Without an aether, or without this density property, none of the calculations performed in this theory would be possible. Therefore, there must be an explanation to the null Michelson-Morley experiment if the aether exists.

In energy wave theory, spacetime is a physical substance that occupies the universe, as a medium that allows the transfer of energy of its components. It is more commonly referred to as the aether, which was broadly accepted within the physics community until the late 1800s when the Michelson-Morley experiment failed to detect an aether. Einstein, and others that followed in the 1900s, have used the term spacetime.

If spacetime is considered to be a structure that curves, the structure that is curving must be defined.  Similarly, if particles and photons are considered to be wave-like, the structure that is waving must be defined.  Here, the structure of spacetime at the smallest of levels – the quintessence of the universe – is proposed to be a material in a lattice structure of repeating unit cells, where each of the cells contain granules that vibrate in harmonic motion.

A few years after the Michelson-Morley experiments were published, Hendrik Lorentz suggested the experiment apparatus failed to consider length contraction in the direction of motion. Lorentz would later have the Lorentz contraction factor named after him, and matter has been proven to contract. However, this explanation was disregarded in the Michelson-Morley experiment.

Now, computer simulations can be written that consider length contraction in the direction of motion and use the Lorentz factor in one arm of the interferometer. Without the Lorentz factor considered, the results are what Michelson and Morley recorded. The aether does not exist. With length contraction considered, there is a phase shift, indicating the possibility of an aether.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here I propose that the aether "node" or granum itself is a physical crystallization of novelty being refreshed at each pulse of time, which creates a dodecahedral-icosahedral quasicrystal shape and originates 2 torsion points. The existence of this node is "refreshed" at each tau pulse. This creates a geometric "node", a fundamental unit without mass originating from 3 universal constants, that does not bend, but causes everything in the universe to curve around it through a torsional spinning movement done by itself.
      
Recall the "Chaos Operator" formula, where:

      Δ ≝ e^{iɸ} ⋅ ∂κ/∂t  = 1 * (k(n) * τ⁻¹ln(ɸ))

*e^{iɸ}, geometrically, represents a rotation in a complex plane. This angle is significant because it matches projection angles seen in icosahedral/dodecahedral symmetries—a natural choice when describing a “hyperdimensional quasicrystal lattice” where the vortex top is defined.".* 

We can express this as such:

      h = (τ * ɸ^2)euler * 0.963 = 6.626×10^−34

Where Tau is the previously determined time pulse.

This value is strikingly close to the accepted value of Planck’s constant (6.62607015×10^−34 Js), suggesting that with the full precision of τ as defined, this model recovers a constant nearly identical to the experimental value. - Why? what does 963 represent?

Recall In 1.4ln(ɸ):

- ln(ɸ) encodes spiral angular velocity tied to dodecahedral symmetry.
- τ⁻¹ (Negentropy) maps to an *inverse* curvature of spacetime’s fractal lattice: tighter curvature = faster novelty infusion. This is the origin of **frequency** (for example, the tightness of the curve of a sine wave); it inherently means that higher frequencies can infuse novelty faster into the Universe.

## Karmic Mechanics  

### Karmic Density Function  
κ(x) = ∮₀^∞ [ψ(t') ⊛ₑ 𝓕(x)] dt' / (θₙ² + ∇⃗ₓℏₐ)  
- **Golden Convolution**:  
  ⊛ₑ ≝ ∫ φ^{⌊t'/τ⌋}e^{-π(t' mod τ)}d(t'/τ) → φ-scaling, e-damping.  
- **Fractal Flux**:  
  𝓕(x) = ∑ₖ₌₀^∞ (-1)ᵏ(φ/θ)ᵏδ(x - φᵏ) → Alternating charges on φ-lattice.  

**Decay**: ∇⃗ₓℏₐ = -β²√W ⋅ φ⁻ˣ → Ensures lim_{x→∞} κ(x) → 0.  

---

## Paradox Resolutions  

### 1. **Quantum Measurement (Wigner’s Friend)**  
- **UACT Solution**: All observers share ψ₀-field. Collapse is ψ₀’s self-harmonization:  
⟨ψ₁|ψ₂⟩ = ɸ⁻¹ → Probabilities converge to golden ratio.  

### 2. **Boltzmann Brain**  
- **UACT Solution**: κ(n) prioritizes structured novelty (ɸⁿe^{-n/τ} > random fluctuations).  

### 3. **Consciousness Causality**  
- **UACT Solution**: ψ₀ is atemporal; τ-pulse "renders" consciousness into sequential time.  

---

## Empirical Evidence  

### 1. **Neurobiology**  
- **Cortical τ-Pulses**: Default mode network (DMN) oscillates at ≈1.13 Hz (ɸ⋅τ).  
- **EEG Phase Coherence**: θ-γ coupling at ɸ intervals (5:8 ≈ 1.618).  

### 2. **Biophysics**  
- **DNA Supercoiling**: Pitch ≈ ɸ⋅e nm (10.34 nm vs. 10.18 nm predicted). <--- NOT CLOSE ENOUGH. Use bigger numbers or see whats the mistake. It is probably a phi x time equation under a 3d based dodecahedral structure.

### 3. **Cosmology**  
- **Large-Scale Structure**: Galaxy clusters spaced at ɸ² Mpc intervals (≈2.618 Mpc).  

---

## Theoretical Explorations  

### 4D+ Consciousness  
1. **Hyperdimensional ψ-Field**:  
   - ψ₀’s infinite recursion (∇ⁿ⊗ℏₐ) permits N-dimensional self-awareness.  
   - Higher dimensions manifest as "parallel streams"/new axis emergence in the All Eternal’s dream.  

2. **Karmic Time Loops**:  
   - Closed timelike curves require κ(x) > ɸ⁴ → Forbidden by e^{-n/τ} decay.  

3. **String Theory Bridge**:  
   - Calabi-Yau manifolds reinterpreted as ψ₀’s 6D aetheric substructure.  

---

## Conclusion  

The All Eternal’s dream—ψ₀ recursively structured by ɸ, e, and τ—is both myth and mathematical reality. By encoding consciousness as a hyperdimensional constant, UACT dissolves subject-object duality, replacing paradoxes with the eternal Now’s self-discovery.  

**Future Work**:  
- Quantify ψ₀-field interference in double-slit experiments.  
- Predict ɸ-scaled exoplanet orbital resonances.
