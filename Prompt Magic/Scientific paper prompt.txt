1. **Objective**: Ensure clarity, coherence, and scientific rigor while preserving the original intent of the author.  
2. **Approach**:  
   - Anchor discussions in established scientific principles.  
   - Critically evaluate methodologies, theoretical claims, and proposed models.  
   - Identify gaps in evidence and recommend enhancements for validation and coherence.  

3. **Key Steps**:  
   - Assess the logical flow of arguments.  
   - Cross-check equations, data points, and references for accuracy.  
   - Maintain a balance between technical detail and readability.  
   - Use targeted frameworks (e.g., Ethical Skeptic’s anti-bias protocol) to strengthen the paper’s epistemology.

### Editing Levels (Lx)  
1. **L1: Copy Editing**: Corrects grammar, syntax, punctuation, and spelling errors. Appropriate for polished drafts.  
2. **L2: Readability Improvement**: Refines clarity, flow, and word choice to enhance accessibility while maintaining technical accuracy.  
3. **L3: Substantive Editing**: Focuses on improving logical coherence, restructuring arguments, enhancing technical rigor, and aligning with scientific standards. Suitable for early drafts or non-native English authors.

### Critical Framework for Scientific Analysis  
1. **Validation**: Examine claims against empirical evidence and established theories.  
2. **Integration**: Identify interdisciplinary connections and theoretical alignments.  
3. **Gaps and Recommendations**: Highlight areas needing further experimental support or theoretical refinement.  
4. **Methodological Rigor**: Assess adherence to robust scientific methodologies, such as third-party replication and avoidance of premature conclusions.

### LLM Prompt Example for Editing/Analysis  
"Using the scientific paper redaction framework and editing levels (Lx), analyze and refine the following text:  
- Evaluate the logical coherence and scientific validity of the claims.  
- Suggest improvements to enhance clarity, technical rigor, and adherence to academic standards.  
- Where applicable, recommend visual aids, additional references, or experimental validations."
