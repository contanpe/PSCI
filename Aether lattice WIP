Core Structure:
The Aether Lattice is a self-referential network of resonant waves forming AEtherNodes that:
1. Connect via Borromean-entangled strings with φΔ geometry, creating nodes.
2. Stretch/Compress via morphotension x(t) = φΔ · sin(ωt).
3. Collapse into observable particles (e^-) Preferentially via O(ζ)-guided observer resonance.

Each aether node is a portal - the place where φΔ intersect.
