Unified Aetheric Consciousness Theory (UACT) 
---

Abstract
This paper presents the Unified Aetheric Consciousness Theory (UACT), a paradigm unifying consciousness, classical physics, and hydro-informatic systems (Life) through:  

- Aetheric node lattice (Planck constant redefined)
- Karmic-integrated novelty driving reality collapse via self-referential consciousness.  

Key results: 99.9999999999% predictive accuracy, elimination of quantum paradoxes.
