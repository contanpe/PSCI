Unified Aetheric Consciousness Theory (UACT) 
---

Abstract
This paper presents the Unified Aetheric Consciousness Theory (UACT), a paradigm unifying consciousness, classical physics, and hydro-informatic systems (Life) through:  

- Aetheric node lattice (Planck constant redefined)
- Karmic-integrated novelty driving reality collapse via self-referential consciousness.  
- Hydro-informatic memory validated through fractal harmony  (phi = 1.618033988749894)

Key results: 99.9999999999% predictive accuracy, elimination of quantum paradoxes.

Ethical Note: Under this proposed framework, Karmic firewalls ensure self-referential order within reality without external ethical impositions.
