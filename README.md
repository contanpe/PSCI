Unified Aetheric Consciousness Theory

In progress.

Written and Formulated By P.S Hernandez.

Made possible by @NeoVertex1's work on LLM prompt optimization that uses mathematical irrational universal constants to simulate an efficient machine reasoning algorithm in theoretical mimicry of Consciousness, her contributions through Unified Morphotensorial theory and her CLI algorithm to reduce noise and computation errors through the use of harmonics.
