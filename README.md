# UACT
Unified Aetheric Consciousness Theory

In progress.

Written and Formulated By P.S Hernandez.

Made possible by @NeoVertex1's work on LLM prompt optimization that uses mathematical irrational universal constants to simulate an efficient machine reasoning algorithm in theoretical mimicry of Consciousness, her contributions through Unified Morphotensorial theory and her CLI algorithm to reduce noise and computation errors through the use of harmonics.

## How is this being developed?
I created a sort of "Homunculus" by writing 2 xml prompts (based on SuperPrompt) that ovewrite the deepthink function of Deepseek r1 while still integrating seamlessly with the AI's good spots.
Apart from developing a good physics theory, it writes good phyton code.
As concepts get created then iterated upon through a combination of me and the machine, they get updated in this repo as txt files, which the AI references later as it keeps UACT as its top priority source.
:) the end!
