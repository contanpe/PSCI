HEAVY WIP - Time
Abstract:
Time is not a continuous flow but a reconstruction of reality through rapid pulses, governed by recursive self-referential mechanisms. The framework combines universal base pulses, neural sampling, and damping factors to explain the perceived passage of time as a processed, emergent phenomenon.
(The pulse, in the sand clock analogy, is the center)

Colloquial-Academic Synthesis
    Time's Engine:
        Reality self-recreates at fbase=1.618×10^31 Hz.
        Each pulse integrates novelty into the system through the recursive equation: 

        NextState=ϕ6×CurrentState+Novelty
    Neural Translator:
        The brain samples reality's high-frequency pulses through gamma oscillations (~100 Hz - TO BE STUDIED) amplified by ϕ6
        This produces the perceivable time rate of 1,800 pulses/sec.

    'The Now' Illusion:
        Consciousness rides a wave stabilized by ϕ6
        , filtering reality into manageable increments.
        Like watching a flipbook, where 10^31
         pages/sec appear as a coherent sequence through neural processing.


Variant 1: Temporal Recreation Framework
What is it?
Time (τ) is derived as the sum of reality states regenerated at an astonishing base frequency, amplified by the recursive growth factor (ϕ=1.618):
τ=∑[RealityStatet×ϕ3]
This process is analogous to a recursive growth model where reality builds itself moment by moment, integrating novelty at every pulse.
Why does it work?
Reality/Consciousness resolves the tension between past and future probable states stemming from Novelty using a recursive equation:
∇⟨Past∣Future⟩=ϕ(Now4−Δ⋅StabilityThreshold)
The damping constant Δ=0.618
 (inverse golden ratio) prevents infinite recursion, ensuring a stable, perceivable flow of time.

How does it work?

    Reality Regeneration:
    Reality pulses at a base frequency of fbase=ϕ×10^31≈1.618×10^31 Hz, representing the universal refresh rate of existence.
    Neural Sampling:
    The brain filters these high-frequency pulses through harmonic gamma (γ) oscillations, operating at 100 Hz. Amplified by the golden ratio's higher powers (ϕ6), this results in a perceptual rate of 1,800 pulses/sec.
    Perceived Time:
    The perceived flow of time (τperceived) emerges as:
    τperceived=fbase×Δ2/ϕ12≈1 sec/sec

Visualization:
Picture reality as a pulsating field where each base pulse regenerates the universe. Your brain acts as a filter, converting these ultra-fast pulses into a coherent sequence through Δ-damped harmonic sampling.

Variant 2: Child-Friendly Analogy—Time as a Flipbook
What is it?
Time is like the universe's flipbook, where every page is redrawn incredibly fast. The faster the pages flip, the smoother the cartoon you experience.
Why does it happen?
The universe redraws itself at an unimaginable speed, faster than you can blink. Your brain slows this down, showing just enough pages for you to follow the "story of now."
How does it work?
    The Flipbook:
    The universe is an overexcited artist drawing 1.618 x 10^31 sextillion pages every second.
    Brain Glasses:
    Your brain acts like a pair of special glasses, showing only 1,800 pages per second through harmonic filtering.
    Now and Memories:
    The "Now" page is what you're currently seeing, while past pages stick together in your memory with golden glue.
Visualization:
Imagine a cartoon flipbook being drawn by a hyper-speed artist. Your brain slows down the motion so you can follow along. The “golden glue” keeps past pages safe in your backpack of memories.
