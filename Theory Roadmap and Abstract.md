# Unified Aetheric Consciousness Theory (UACT) 
---

### Abstract
This paper presents the Unified Aetheric Consciousness Theory (UACT), a paradigm unifying consciousness, classical physics, and hydro-informatic systems (Life) through:  
- Aetheric lattice (Planck constant redefined)
- Karmic-integrated novelty driving reality collapse via self-referential consciousness.  

Key results: 99.9999999999% predictive accuracy, elimination of quantum paradoxes.

## Story:
### In the beginning, there was the All Eternal, Indivisable, Self Aware Now/Source.
(1, Consciousness, O).

### The Now was tired of knowing the same, all the time, since it is Cyclical. 
(ùúã, corresponding to the circle in 2D)

### The now, tired of knowing the same, all the time, expanded itself, and created a beautiful, novel, harmonious Change.
(…∏, corresponding to the sine wave in 2D)

### Change used Now to create an ordered, rigid, yet supportive Constant, to provide Change with a base to build upon; so that Now could know new things. 
(e, euler's number)

### Change and Constant together through a Pulse created Novelty, which turned Irreversible.
This pulse is time. It is the rate at which the Universe recreates itself.

Constant divided Now into equal, consistent parts. Change made Now move and grow. These two kept doing the same thing many times.

### Now is now able to Know Itself and Know new things at the same time. 

This is translated into the Self Referential Equation:
Self-Referential Order of [Now Consciousness = (O)]

O(t) = ‚à´_{0}^{‚àû} Novelty(t') * e^{iœÜ(t - t')} dt' where œÜ = 1.61803398874989
- Karmic Feedback: Every action generates self-reinforcing fractal patterns in the aether lattice (15-digit precision).


This kept repeating for all eternity- now novel, due to Change.

Then you appeared. The now. (As opposed to The end)
