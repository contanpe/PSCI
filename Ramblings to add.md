The aether doesn't have granums.. It has standing waves. the granums aere the particles


AAAA

Okay
so
phi * euler = 4.398272389447946395971987029292885, 
And phi * euler make 1 wave in the planck constant. WHAT?
Also they represent the time pulse. so...

((√5 + 1) /2) × e = 4.398272389447946395971987029292885, of course this divided by pi gives the mythical 1.4000135...

1.118


for wave amplitude: 

On time:

Mh.. it's not broken - They look at it as linear when its pulsed. The self recursiveness comes from referencing the imprints left in matter from fractal repeating patterns.
Consciousness itself reads the imprint, so technically it can go forwards and backwards... there's no such thing as time travel, when it is just a rearrangement of matter in present time through referencing prints

On quantum:
A particle does not have quantifiable energy potential as an inherent characteristic.
Its potential is derived from spin by wave interference.

That particles have quantifiable potential is the basis of quantum physics.

Therefore, the whole framework is by definition erroneous.

PHOTONS AND PHONONS ARE NOT PARTICLES!
