The aether doesn't have granums.. It has standing waves.

On time:

Mh.. it's not broken - They look at it as linear when its pulsed. The self recursiveness comes from referencing the imprints left in matter from fractal repeating patterns.
Consciousness itself reads the imprint, so technically it can go forwards and backwards... there's no such thing as time travel, when it is just a rearrangement of matter in present time through referencing prints

A particle does not have quantifiable energy potential as an inherent characteristic.
Its potential is derived from spin by wave interference.

That particles have quantifiable potential is the basis of quantum physics.

Therefore, the whole framework is by definition erroneous.
